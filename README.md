# Telephone-book
This is a consol version of a telephone book made as a homework that I recieved on my C# courses in ITMO University.
The pogram has a sessional inormation storage, so all the notes are available during only one session.

IMPORTANT INFO! The program is made on Russian language, so I guess it can be used only by Russian-speakers.
